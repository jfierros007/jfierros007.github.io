    <h1>Pangolins</h1>

    <h2>One of the most trafficked animals</h2>

        Though many think of them as reptiles, pangolins are actually mammals.
        They are the only mammals wholly-covered in scales and they use those
        scales to protect themselves from predators in the wild.
        If under threat, a pangolin will immediately curl into a
        tight ball and will use their sharp-scaled tails to defend themselves.
        <br>

        <br>
        Pangolins eat ants, termites and larvae and are
        often known as "the scaly anteater."
        Because they have no teeth, pangolins pick up
        food with their sticky tongues, which can sometimes
        reach lengths greater than the animal’s body.
        <br>

        <br>
        They certainly are one of the most trafficked mammals in Asia and,
        increasingly, Africa. Pangolins are in high demand in countries like China
        and Vietnam. Their meat is considered a delicacy and pangolin scales are
        used in traditional medicine and folk remedies. All eight pangolin
        species are protected under national and international laws. But there is
        still growing international illegal trade in pangolins.
        <br>

        <br>
        Based on reported seizures between 2011 and 2013,
        an estimated 116,990-233,980 pangolins were killed,
        which represents only the tip of the trade. Experts
        believe that seizures represent as little as 10 percent
        of the actual volume in pangolins in illegal wildlife trade.
        <br>

        <br>
        In 2016, a treaty of over 180 governments announced an
        agreement that would end all legal trade of pangolins
        and further protect the species from extinction.
        However, illegal trade of the species continues. WWF,
        together with TRAFFIC, works to protect species from wildlife
        crime. In Asia, we work to reduce consumer demand for illegal
        wildlife products with campaigns and partnerships with governments
        and businesses.
        <br>

        <br>
        In June 2020, China increased protection
        for the native Chinese Pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) to the
        highest level, which closed an important loophole for consumption
        of the species in-country. Additionally, the government will
        no longer allow the use of pangolin scales in traditional
        medicine, a big win given that an estimated 195,000 pangolins
        were trafficked in 2019 for their scales alone.
